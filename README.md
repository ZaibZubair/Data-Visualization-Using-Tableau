# Data_Visualization_Using_Tableau


* In 'Median Wage Per Subgroup' file, we created a basic __bar chart__ to see how median paid wages per year varies for different job subgroups.

* In 'Visa Class Relationship with Salary', we dig deeper into rows and columns shelves by placing more __dimensions and measures__. Different features of __mark cards__ were also tested to observe the relationship betwween visa class and salary.It was observed that visa class does not have strong relationship with salary.

* In 'Checking For Outliers', we learnt how to remove __outliers using scatterplot, filtering and making groups__. We made a case number group which represent outlier values and other values to see how it effects the result.

* In 'Jobs By State', we analyzed data-related salaries in different states using filtering and groups. We made a work state group to include specific countries with high tech related industries. We add this group to Filter tabs so we can select whichever country we need to see results for.

* In 'Best Fit Lines Over Time',we learnt __line graphs__ and see how to use date as hiearchical dimensions or measures. We analyzed data related salaries over time using __date hiearchies and trend lines(linear regression)__.

* In 'Box Plots', we analyzed data related salaries over time using __box plots__.

* In 'Companies That Pay Below Prevailing Wage Per Year', we identified companies that pay less than prevailing wage. We learnt how to write differnt __calculation types__ which makes filtering more efficient.We write a calculation which counts the difference between prevailing wage and paid wage per year.

* In 'Salaries Adjusted For Cost Of Living', we experienced __blending and aggregation-level calculations__. We blended the price parity (price_parity.xlxs) data with salary data (salary_data_states_corrected (1)) and adjusted data-related salaries for cost of living.

* In 'Top States For Data Jobs', we learnt how to use __table calculations__ to figure out which states across the country have the highest salaries for different data related jobs, once you take cost of living into account.

* In 'Top Companies For Data Jobs',we learnt the use of __parameter__ as an alternative to putting the break calculation to find how many states we will look in every single job title subgroup. We also calculated which companies have the top adjusted salaries within job subcategories.

* In 'Dashboard For Top State and Companies', we created a __dashboard__ which are very useful for data analytics and making decisions. We made a dashboard to help us figure out what companies we would like to apply to get data-related jobs in different states.

The __Tableau stories__ are bunch of worksheets that are made up into a sequence that we design. Each worksheet can have an entire dashboard on it, a separate visualization, or really whatever we want. The main important part about stories that's different than dashboards is that the stories are ordered in a logical sequence, so that you can present the data to your audience in a sequence that makes it most likely that they will arrive at the same conclusion you did when they look at your data.

* In 'Visual Story Points For Presentation Purpose', we made __tableau stories__ to tell which states can be best for data related jobs and also which companies among thoses states can be best suited.
