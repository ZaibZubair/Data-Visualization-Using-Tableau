# Data_Visualization_Using_Tableau


* In 'Median Wage Per Subgroup' file, we created a basic bar chart to see how median paid wages per year varies for different job subgroups.

* In 'Visa Class Relationship with Salary', we dig deeper into rows and columns shelves ba placing more dimensions and measures. Different features of mark cards were also tested to observe the relationship betwween visa class and salary.It was observed that visa class does not have strong relationship with salary.

* In 'Checking For Outliers', we learnt how to remove outliers using scatterplot, filtering and making groups. We made a case number group which represent outlier values and other values to see how it effects the result.

* In 'Jobs By State', we analyzed data-related salaries in different states using filtering and groups. We made a work state group to include specific countries with high tech related industries. We add this group to Filter tabs so we can select whichever country we need to see results for.

* In 'Best Fit Lines Over Time',we learnt line graphs and see how to use date as hiearchical dimensions or measuees. We analyzed data related salaries over time using date hiearchies and trend lines(linear regression).

* In 'Box Plots', we analyzed data related salaries over time using box plots.

* In 'Companies That Pay Below Prevailing Wage Per Year', we identified companies that pay less than prevailing wage. We learnt how to write differnt calculation types which makes filtering more efficient.We write a calculation which counts the difference between prevailing wage and paid wage per year.

* In 'Salaries Adjusted For Cost Of Living', we experienced blending and aggregation-level calculations. We blended the price parity (price_parity.xlxs) data with salary data (salary_data_states_corrected (1)) and adjusted data-related salaries for cost of living.

* In 'Top States For Data Jobs' 

* In 'Top Companies For Data Jobs'

* In 'Dashboard For Top State and Companies'
